## üéØ Project Objective

This project simulates a scalable and secure enterprise network architecture for a company with a main headquarters and multiple remote branches. It reflects real-world IT infrastructure used in small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), incorporating essential elements that an IT Helpdesk or Network Administrator may encounter.

Key objectives include:
- Enhancing network segmentation and security via VLANs, ACLs, and firewall zones.
- Implementing centralized services (DHCP, DNS) with redundancy (HSRP, EtherChannel).
- Demonstrating inter-site connectivity via WAN and site-to-site VPNs.
- Applying CCNA-level concepts in a practical simulation environment.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Role

I independently designed and implemented the entire network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer, including:
- IP subnetting and VLAN planning for multiple departments.
- Configuring Cisco routers, Layer 2/3 switches, and ASA firewall.
- Deploying DHCP relay, DNS, ACLs, NAT, and static/dynamic routing (EIGRP).
- Testing communication between departments, zones, and across WAN links.
- Documenting the architecture and producing a test plan for validation.

## ‚ñ∫ Project Overview

This topology demonstrates a hierarchical, multi-zone security architecture with centralized services and WAN connectivity.

### Key Architectural Features:
- **Hierarchical Design:** The HQ network follows the 3-tier model (Core, Distribution, Access).
- **Multi-Zone Security:** ASA Firewall segments traffic into `inside`, `dmz`, `outside`, and `branch` zones.
- **Redundancy:** Implemented using HSRP for gateway failover and EtherChannel (LACP) for aggregated links.
- **Routing:** EIGRP for dynamic WAN routing, static routes for firewall zone control.
- **Centralized Services:** DHCP and DNS centrally hosted and served using `ip helper-address`.

## üß™ How to Run and Test This Simulation

### Requirements:
- Cisco Packet Tracer **v8.x or later**
- File: `Basic_Multi-Branch-LogicalNetwork.pkt`

### Steps:
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Packet Tracer.
2. Power on all devices (if powered off).
3. Use CLI to explore configurations (`enable ‚Üí show run`).
4. Run the following tests:

#### Internal Communication:
- `Ping` between VLAN 10 (PC0) and VLAN 20 (PC2)
- DHCP assignment verification on PCs

#### DMZ Access:
- On PC0, open Web Browser ‚Üí access: `http://192.168.100.10`
- Ping Email Server at `192.168.100.20`

#### Remote Connectivity:
- `Ping` from PC0 (HQ) to PC5 (Remote Site) ‚Äì `192.168.200.10`
- Verify VPN tunnel via `show crypto` on ASA (if configured)

#### Redundancy Test (Optional):
- Shut down one of the HSRP routers and confirm gateway continuity via `show standby`
